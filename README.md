My activist toolkit is advocating for teachers low salary and how they deserve a raise. Teachers work long stressful hours and they're still underpaid to the point they can't afford 
to support themselves and their family financially. So i feel like others should know about this cause and help support the movement since many inspired teachers feel
discouraged about becoming teachers because they're afraid that they won't make enough money to support themselves.
