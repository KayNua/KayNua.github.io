          I created this project advocating for teachers pay raise because many people like myself feel discouraged about becoming teachers because they donâ€™t get pay enough. This means that people are less likely to try to become teachers, raising teachers salary will increase the likelihood of hiring qualified teachers who put in effort to earned top scores on their educator certification exams. A higher salary will also improve performance in students.
